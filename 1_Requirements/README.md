# Introduction
These days, even non-luxury compact and family cars are available with rain-sensing wipers. These systems utilize an LED sensor, fitted between the windshield and rearview mirror, to detect the amount of rain or snow falling on the windshield.There are a number of infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and a central photodiode which make up the “rain sense” portion of the system.The invisible light emitted by the LEDs is reflected by the windshield onto the photo sensor. Therefore the more moisture there is on the windshield, the less light the sensor receives. This information is subsequently relayed to a computer control unit, which then adjusts the intermittent wiper delay intervals of the accordingly.The wetter it gets, the faster the rain sensing wipers work to help give you a clear view of what's in front of you. When the system senses drier conditions, such as when the vehicle is stopped at a red light and the rain is falling less intensely, the wipers will gradually slow down before switching themselves off when no longer needed.

#  **Advantages:**
- It helps in saving money by switching off the irrigation system when it rains.
- Less Power Consumption.
- High Accuracy.

#  **Disadvantages:**
- This system applied in case of water falling on glass only.
- Addition cost is required to install system for For wheelers.

# **SWOT Analysis:**
# Strength
1) Whenever the water hit a dedicated sensor that located on windscreen, it will send a signal to move on the wiper motor. Once water is not detected by sensor, the wiper will automatically stop. This will help the driver to give more concentration and reduce the car accident probability.
2) It helps in saving money by switching off the irrigation system when it rains. This saves money by cutting off bills on electricity consumption.
3) It extends life of rain sensor based systems such as car wiper, irrigation systems by running them only when it is necessary.
4) Rain sensors help save water during rain events and hence water is available during summer and emergency applications such as firefighting etc.
5) Operating principle is very easy.
6) It consumes less power for operation.
7) Installation of rain sensor based systems are very much simple.
8) Individual rain sensor costs very less.
# Weakness
1) The rain sensor based system functions when water falls on the sensor directly.
2) The cost of overall system increases as additional components are needed along with rain sensor.
3) In order to avoid false detection of rain, it requires rain sensors to take decision after few minutes.

# **Threats:**
- MTM delayed adaptation.
- User acceptance in terms both purchase intention and frequent activation after purchase.

### Who?
- With view of sensing the obstacle wiper is control system is being user by all heavy vehicle/automobile user's (like car, truck, train, chopper).It can help people driving vehicles in terrain, roads, hill station and highways.

### What?

- 3 LEDS are used in the wiper system.

### When?

- It is used when the key ignition is turned ON/OFF where three LED's are turned ON/OFF depending the frequency.

### Where?

- IT is used in heavy vehicle/automobile
### How?

- IT  can be achieved throught the analog to digital convertor, LEDS, timer's and so on..
